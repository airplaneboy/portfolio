## I'm Sulaiman,

an aspiring computer science student with a broad background in technology. My journey has taken me through various fields, including web development, game development, and 3D animation, alongside my current role serving in the Army Reserves as a CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) specialist.

#### Professional Background

I briefly worked as a network security analyst at the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria, gaining key insights into network security. Most of my expertise, however, comes from personal projects that have allowed me to explore and master a variety of technologies.

One of my notable projects is a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) with all the essential features for creating and managing courses.

#### Game Development and 3D Animation

In game development and 3D animation, I've worked with:

- **Game Engines:** Unity 3D
- **Programming Languages:** C#, Java
- **3D Modeling and Animation Tools:** Blender, Substance Painter, Marvelous Designer

These tools have allowed me to create engaging and immersive experiences.

#### Work Philosophy

My approach is simple: take the time to do a commendable job and avoid shortcuts, ensuring that my work is functional, reliable, and sustainable.

#### Personal Interests

Outside of work, I enjoy running, working out, and playing video games. I'm also a fan of rap music, horror movies, and first-person shooters.

#### Looking Forward

I plan to study computer science at Temple University with the goal of making contributions to the field.
