## I'm Sulaiman,

an aspiring computer science student with a broad background in tech. My journey has taken me through various fields, including web development, game development, and 3D animation, alongside my current role serving in the Army Reserves as a CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) specialist. I’m OSHA 10-Hour General Industry certified, so I ensure that safety and professionalism are always prioritized.

#### Professional Background

I briefly worked as a network security analyst at the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria where I gained key insights into network security. Most of my expertise, however, comes from personal projects that have allowed me to explore and master a variety of technologies.

#### Web Development Expertise

My primary focus is on web development, where I use Next.js to create dynamic and efficient web applications. My toolkit includes:

- **Programming Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Styling and Animations:** Tailwind CSS, GSAP
- **Backend Development:** Express.js
- **Databases:** MongoDB
- **Content Management:** Sanity CMS

One of my notable projects is a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) with all the essential features for creating and managing courses.

#### Game Development and 3D Animation

In game development and 3D animation, I've worked with:

- **Game Engines:** Unity 3D
- **Programming Languages:** C#, Java
- **3D Modeling and Animation Tools:** Blender, Substance Painter, Marvelous Designer

These tools have allowed me to create engaging and immersive experiences.

#### OSHA 10-Hour General Industry Certification

In addition to my technical skills, I’ve completed the OSHA 10-Hour General Industry Course. Maintaining a safe and compliant work environment, whether in the tech industry or any other field, is important to me, and this course provided me with essential knowledge on workplace safety standards, hazard recognition, and risk management. I make sure I bring an extra layer of responsibility and awareness to all my projects, and ensure safety is always a top priority.

#### Work Philosophy

My approach is simple: take the time to do a commendable job and avoid shortcuts, ensuring that my work is functional, reliable, and sustainable.

#### Personal Interests

Outside of work, I enjoy running, working out, and playing video games. I'm also a fan of rap music, horror movies, and first-person shooters.

#### Looking Forward

I plan to study computer science at Columbia University with the goal of working with new people, and learning how I could contribute positively to the world around me.
